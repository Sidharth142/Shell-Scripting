# Disk Cleanup and Backup Script

## Overview

This script is designed to help manage disk space by monitoring disk usage on your system. When the disk usage on any partition exceeds a set threshold, the script automatically compresses and archives files older than 30 days from that partition, then deletes the original files to free up space.

## How It Works

1. **Threshold Check**: The script monitors each partition on your system. If any partition’s disk usage exceeds 90%, it triggers the cleanup process.

2. **File Archiving**: Files older than 30 days in the partition are compressed into a `.tar` archive (a single file that contains multiple files).

3. **File Deletion**: After successfully creating the archive, the original files are deleted, freeing up disk space.

4. **Email Notification**: Once the archival is completed, the script can be configured to send a notification email (if configured), informing you that the cleanup process has finished.

## Script Details

- **Threshold**: The disk usage threshold is set to 90%. You can adjust this by changing the `tr` variable in the script if you want a different limit.
- **Archive Location**: Archived files are stored in a backup location, named with the partition name and date of the archive.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure there is a directory (e.g., `/bkup`) for storing the backup archives. Update the `$bkup` variable in the script with the correct backup path if needed.
- Ensure the script has permission to access and modify files in the target partitions.
- To enable email notifications, configure the system’s email service (e.g., sendmail or mailx) and add the necessary email command in the script.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a terminal or set it to run at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily) using a cron job.
2. **Monitor Free Space**: This script helps keep partitions from filling up by automatically archiving and deleting old files.

## Important Notes

- **Backup Location**: Check the backup folder periodically to ensure it doesn’t consume too much space.
- **Data Retention**: Files older than 30 days will be archived and deleted. Ensure this fits your data retention needs.

## Disclaimer

This script deletes files as part of the cleanup process. Use it carefully, especially in partitions with important data. It’s recommended to test the script in a safe environment before using it on critical systems.
