# AWS Resource Tracker

**Version**: v1

This script reports the usage of various AWS resources including S3, EC2, Lambda, and IAM Users. It provides a quick summary of the resources in your AWS account.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI must be configured with access permissions.
- `jq` should be installed to process JSON output.

## Features
The script performs the following tasks:
- Lists all S3 buckets in the AWS account.
- Lists all EC2 instances and displays their instance IDs.
- Lists all Lambda functions.
- Lists all IAM users.

## Usage
1. Grant execute permissions to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x aws_resource_tracker.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./aws_resource_tracker.sh | more
   ```
   The `| more` command lets you view the output in a paginated format.

## Additional Notes
- The script uses `set -x` to enable debug mode.
- The `stty sane` command resets terminal settings if there are any display issues.
- `jq` is used to filter JSON output for EC2 instance IDs.
