# AWS Resource Listing Script

**Version**: v1

This script automates the process of listing resources for various AWS services in a specified region. Itâ€™s useful for quickly viewing the resources you have in your AWS account for supported services.

## Supported Services
This script supports listing resources for the following AWS services:
1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
2. RDS (Relational Database Service)
3. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
4. CloudFront
5. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
6. IAM (Identity and Access Management)
7. Route53
8. CloudWatch
9. CloudFormation
10. Lambda
11. SNS (Simple Notification Service)
12. SQS (Simple Queue Service)
13. DynamoDB
14. EBS (Elastic Block Store)

## Usage
### Running the Script
The script requires two inputs:
1. **AWS Region** (e.g., `us-west-2`)
2. **AWS Service** (e.g., `ec2`, `s3`, `lambda`, etc.)

#### Example:
```bash
./aws_resource_list.sh us-west-2 ec2
```
This example lists all EC2 instances in the `us-west-2` region.

### Steps:
1. **Make the script executable** (only needed once):
   ```bash
   chmod +x aws_resource_list.sh
   ```
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./aws_resource_list.sh <aws_region> <aws_service>
   ```
   Replace `<aws_region>` with the AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`) and `<aws_service>` with the service name (e.g., `ec2`).

## Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) must be installed and configured on your machine.
  - **Installation**: Follow the AWS CLI [installation guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
  - **Configuration**: Run `aws configure` to set up your AWS credentials.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that the IAM user has the necessary permissions to list resources in your AWS account.

## How It Works
1. The script checks if both region and service arguments are provided.
2. It validates if AWS CLI is installed and configured.
3. It lists the resources for the specified service in the given region.

## Error Handling
- If the required arguments are missing, the script provides usage instructions.
- If the AWS CLI is not installed or configured, it will prompt you to install or configure it.
- If an invalid service is entered, the script displays an error.
